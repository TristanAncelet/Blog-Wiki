= Busy Week =
-------------
I've been exceptionally busy this week at work. We had some high profile projects that my department was being forced to assist with (the projects were another depts). Which unfortunately put us behind on our own projects.

== Did I do any Tickets ==
--------------------------
No unfortunately I haven't had time to pick up any tickets from the board. Although with any luck next week I will be able to pick one up (as I kinda feel useless).
