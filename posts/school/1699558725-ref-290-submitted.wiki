== Further Work ==
To finish off what I've done for my REF:
- I (after talking with my lead) had to bind a view (R.id.timeout_text_input as timoutInput) and call timeoutInput.setError in the section needing to present errors (MoreFragment.java)
- Had to add errorEnabled to TextInputLayoutStyle (as it seems I forgot to do so to begin with despite notating it in my commit).
