I just recently started hosting my own gitserver (gitea). Had a few issues setting it up due to some default values in the gitea.service file (that prevented the program from using port 80).

After getting that dealt with I decided to see what I could do with gitea's support for webhooks. So I decided to setup a webhook that will handle updating my blog when I push to my [[https://git.arcanium.tech/tristan/blog-site|Blog Repo]]. 

Once I push a new addition to the repo it now automatically makes a post request to my webhook server that will automatically update my website without manual intervention.

This post was simply being used to test that functionality in gitea.
